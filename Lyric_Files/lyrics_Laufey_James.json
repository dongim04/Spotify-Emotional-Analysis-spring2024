 "lyrics": "9 ContributorsJames Lyrics\nI spent months gazing at him\nSitting 'cross the hall\nHis dark hair, his glasses\nPerfect overall\nHe looked so serious\nHe was mysterious\nOne Tuesday he caught me sneaking in a stare\nHe shot me a smile\nI nearly tumbled out my chair\nHe said, \"Who are you? My name is James\"\nAnd that's when I fell into the flames\n\nTurns out he's a fool\nThat James\nOh, James\nOh, how I wasted my days\nOh, dreaming, dreaming of James\n\nHe said, \"Do you like museums?\"\n\"They're open late tonight\"\nHow about we go together\nJust you and I\nAnd maybe we can have a drink or two\nI'd like to learn about you\nBut James just thought\nIt was alright\nTo go ahead and talk\nAbout himself all night\nThen he really felt he had to say\nThat he'd be a millionaire one day\nSee Laufey LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also like\nTurns out he's a fool\nThat James\nOh, James\nOh, how I wasted my days\nOh, dreaming, dreaming of James\n\nMy eyes rolled to the back of my head\nIt seemed like the night would never end\nAt one point I just stopped listening\nHis voice just became too sickeningEmbed"
