Yeah\nRidin' in the wind, God bless\nShe's an inferno, it's a hell of a time\n\nBurnin' like a candlelight\nYour love is dangerous\nYour love is, my love is\nOur love is\nBurnin' like a candlelight (Are you not entertained?)\nYour love is dangerous\nYour love is, my love is (Are you not entertained?)\nOur love is\n\nWho's not entertained by my pain?\nWho ain't cash a check off my name?\nWhen my campaign turned to cam-pain\nI burned eight billion to tak\u0435 off my chains\nBurn, baby, burn\nSometimes it hurts, I guess I n\u0435ver learned\nTo who it may concern, the CEO of the firm\nIs now somewhere smoking sherm with Big Worm\nMan, a couple wrong turns\nCould fry you forever, it's a permanent burn\nYou charging for cookie, that's bang for your buck\nIf you kissin' on the mouth, you ain't charging enough\nYou heard I was flyin' 'em out\nThey was tryin' for clout, I was dyin' of gout\nMan, the world gone mad\nHeard R. Kelly in the next Balenciaga ad\nYou might also like\nBurnin' like a candlelight (Burn)\nYour love is dangerous\nYour love is, my love is\nOur love is\nBurnin' like a candlelight\nYour love is dangerous\nYour love is, my love is\nOur love is\n\nHer body like the wild, wild west\nWhat if you don't bow down? Yeah\nRidin' in the wind, God bless\nShe's an inferno, it's a hell of a time7Embed"
