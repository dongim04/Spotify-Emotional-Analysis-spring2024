Impossible\nI'm visual, he's barely audible\nStop giving him the time of day, don't listen to a word he'd say\nI hope he had a nice vacay, but he should've stayed away\nWhile he hid in radio, we've pivoted to video\nNow his medium is getting bloody rare\nHell's been better since he split\nWhere's he been? Who gives a shit?\n\nSalutations!\nGood to be back on the air\nYes, I know it's been a while\nSince someone with style treated Hell to a broadcast\nSinners, rejoice!\n\nWhat a dated voice!\n\nInstead of a clout-chasing mediocre video podcast\n\nCome on!\n\nIs Vox insecure, pursuing allure?\nFlitting between this fad and that, is nothing working?\nIgnore his chirping!\n\nEvery day, he's got a new format!\n\nYou're looking at the future, he's the shit that comes before that!\n\nIs Vox as strong as he purports?\nOr is it based on his support?\nHe'd be powerless without the other Vees\n\nOh, please!\n\nAnd here's the sugar on the cream\nHe asked me to join his team!\n\nH-hold on!\n\nI said no, and now he's pissy\nThat's the tea!\n\nYou old-timey prick, I'll show you suf-ffering\n\nUh oh, the TV is buffering!\n\nI'll destroy you, yo-ou lit-tle\u2014\n\nI'm afraid you've lost your signal\nLet's begin\nI'm gonna make you wish that I'd stayed gone, tune on in\nWhen I'm done, your status quo will know its race is run\nOh, this will be fun\n\nFuck!Embed"
