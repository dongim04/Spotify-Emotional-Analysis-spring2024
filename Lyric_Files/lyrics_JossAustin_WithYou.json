You're done. You're done\nMy girlfriend's getting fucked on the daily...by another guy! AHHH!!! Fuck it!\n\nIf I had to fuck a Clark, it would be Brad\nNot Natalie, Megan, or Sarah, that'd be bad\nNot Kaitlyn, maybe Hannah, nah\nI'd only fuck her if I was blind\nAlex, you'll always be short\nOne day you'll be paying child support\nAaron, we haven't forgotten about the banana you fucked\nAustin, we haven't forgotten that you're a cluck\nI'd call Jason being gay four years ago\nAnd even Tyler, now they both blow\nNick, now it's your turn buddy\nMake sure to put down the McFlurry\nClean up the pizza from your pool\nSparky doesn't think it's cool\nI hate Mylah and Lowi\nMore than I hate Basoui\nRobby tried to fuck Kylee?\nHe aimed too highly\nKayla screams rape as I unzip her pants\nBitch, those are implants\nCynthia got married, what a gold digger\nSam's next in line, do you think he's bigger?\nI'm gonna commit some felonies\nBy breaking into Melody's\nYou know what's really shitty?\nMy ex-girlfriend named Kitty\nI hate this bitch that's a snitch\nAustin; OG Servers will never make you rich\nYou know who has a small penis?\nThis man named Luis\nAdam is a prick\nAdam is a dick\nThis man's got pubes on his face\nThey grew in the wrong place\nAliKali is a slave to Sam\nI wanna throw her off Folsom Dam\nWhere's my chicken fries, you cluck?\nPay Luis back, you shmuck\nYou might also like\nI got a list of women I hate...I'd like to read it out loud to you. Lyndsey, Madeline, Melody, Breaunna McFlurry, and Lauren Blueban. Continue the song\n\nOnce I get into my Mazda\nI'm gonna drive to Alaska\nI'm gonna find Adam and attack him in his igloo shack\nDinger, Dinger, Dinger\nIs a cunt\nDinger, Dinger, Dinger\nStill a cunt\nYour boyfriend cheats on you more than you'll ever know\nHe cheats on you with Megan like a pro (So sorry)\nSam and Ali are perfect for each other\nThat's 'cause they can't find anyone skinnier than one another\nThis song will be bigger than Alanis\nAnd Sarah can get back to Landis\nAnd while Vinn cries over his pregnant ex\nSarah and Landis can have sex\nI'm already a Dehkordi\nI went to William Jessup for a party\nRight now, Jazzy's in Nintendo\nBut one day, she'll be living in the ghetto\nI'm kidding, I know she'll succeed\nAnd she'll be smoking that Seattle weed\nRemember that time Alex peaked?\nIt was the time he got keek'd\nHere comes Luis with his big fat nose\nPut it away dude it's gross\nFat chick for a flat chick?\nYou know Maddies love that Luis dick\nAnd as much as I hate every Maddy\nIt's not as bad as Alex hates Abby\nBut you know what I really hate?\nIs this worthless cunt named Kate\nBitch, I love you\nThere's this girl that I'd like to get friendly\nWith, and her name's Brynlie (I love you Brynlie)\nKylee, your acting career's pretty much done\nIt's worse than your ex-boyfriend, Josh\nAustin more like dumb useless bitch\nHey Tristan, I hope you get AIDS\nTake off those stupid shades\nYou're still stuck in the sixties\nYou're smelly and you hang with hippies\nSneha, I-never mind, I can't insult you\n(Please Kate. Please love me)\nAnyone seen Megan?\nLast I heard she was with a man with one hand\nHailey, you're a cutie\nSorry Adam put a pencil in your booty\nI didn't do it I swear\nI would never even dare\nFuck you Beatrice for the restraining order\nTake the hermit crab and give it to your brother\nHey Aaron\nYou're a moron\nNext up on my list is a queer\nHis name's Hunter, I fear\n(I'm always anti-all gays)\nLet me tell you about this girl, Natalie\nWhen I saw her face, I hella-ran\nIt's happening\nYou know it's happening\nIt's happening\nIt's happening, boys\nI'm in love with Miss Crowe, Crowe\nIt's the Revenge of the Cholo\nI really want some hot cocoa\nI'm in love with Miss Crowe, Crowe\n(Baking soda, baking soda, baking soda)\n(I got baking soda, baking soda, baking soda)\n(Baking soda, baking soda, baking soda)\n(Baking soda, I got baking, baking soda)\nI'm in love with Miss Crowe, Crowe\nShe teaches AP Gov, GovEmbed"
