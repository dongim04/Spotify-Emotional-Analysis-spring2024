 "lyrics": "8 Contributors\u200bsloppy Lyrics\nGod called, she said I'm headed straight into the fire\nBut I like the way that it burns\nKarma keeps showing up and slashing all my tires\nBut maybe that's what I deserve\nFor being so reckless\nEating my breakfast with a side of regret, placing my bets\nEarning my spot on the blacklist\nGod called, she said it's toxic that I like to suffer\nI blocked her number\n\nTried it all, played my role\nDid everything I was told\nBut the universe still has me in a choke hold, so\n\nIf life is gonna fuck me\nThen giv\u0435 it to me sloppy\nOn a silver platter, s\u0435rve me a disaster\nGet undressed, leave a mess worry 'bout it after\n\nGet in bed with my dread\nNothing really matters\nYou might also like\nLast night, I heard my future tapping on my window\nShe was scary, but I let her inside\nDid lines in the bathroom, made out on the floor\nShe tried to stay over so I showed her the door\n\n'Cause I tried it all, played my role\nDid everything that I was told\nBut the universe still has me in a choke hold\n\nIf life is gonna fuck me\nThen give it to me sloppy\nOn a silver platter, serve me a disaster\nGet undressed, leave a mess, worry 'bout it after\n\nIf life is gonna fuck me (fuck me)\nIt better call me mommy\nBend me over backwards\nDare to make me sadder\nGet undressed, leave a mess, worry 'bout it after\n\nGet in bed with my dread\nNothing really matters\nOh, no, no, no\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters\n(Nothing really matters)\nChaos, lovers, train wreck (maybe it's)\nLiving for the sickness\nPsycho, villain, eyes closed\nSloppy but I'm serving\nOh, no, no, no\nNothing really matters\nNothing really mattersEmbed"
