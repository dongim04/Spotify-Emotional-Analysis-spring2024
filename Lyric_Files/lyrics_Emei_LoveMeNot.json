How you feel?\nIt's a slip and slide\nYest\u0435rday was flawless but now I feel like garbage\nAnd if I'm b\u0435ing honest, love you so much I vomit\n\nDo you really love me, do you love me not?\nAm I the girl of your dreams or am I gonna be blocked?\nShould I have another drink to shut up my thoughts?\nDo you really love me, do you love me not?\nDo you really love me, do you love me not?\nDo you think I'm so pathetic? Do you think I'm hot?\nShould I have another drink to shut up my thoughts?\nDo you really love me, do you love me not?\nYou might also like\nDo you really love me?\nDo you think I'm too much?\nAm I hanging by a string?\nAm I pushing my luck?\nBecause you say I'm your beloved\nYou say I'm enough\nBut every time I kick and scream\nYou tell me to shush\n(Shh) You tell me to shush?\nYou tell me to what?\nYou tell me to huh?\nYou tell me that I really shouldn't worry\nAnd I'm blowing it up?\nBut I'm falling in love\nDo you wanna break up?\n\nDo you really love me, do you love me not?\nAm I the girl of your dreams or am I gonna be blocked?\nShould I have another drink to shut up my thoughts?\nDo you really love me, do you love me not?\n\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me not\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me not\nL.O.V.E. on my mind\nI've been hit by this guy called \"stupid cupid\" (Ow)\nL.O.V.E. what's your sign?\n'Cause I think we're aligned but what are you doing?\nL.O.V.E. on my mind\nI've been hit by this guy called \"stupid cupid\"\nL.O.V.E. what's your type?\nLong brown hair with the dark brown eyes?\n\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me not\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me\nDo you love me, love me, love me, love me, love me notEmbed"
