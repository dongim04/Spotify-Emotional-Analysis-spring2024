Very important to get the order right\nOooh! You're a natural, just like my mom!\n\nVeronica, you\u2019re looking good tonight!\n\nWhoa\n(sung)\nA hot guy smiled at me\nWithout a trace of mockery!\nBrainiac cleans up alright\nVeronica is hot tonight!\n\nFreaked, tweaked. Head\u2019s a blur\nHow did I get so popular?\n\nDon't get close, you might ignite\nVeronica is hot tonight!\n\nDreams are coming true\nWhen people laugh but not at you!\nI\u2019m not alone! I'm not afraid!\nI feel like Bono at LiveAid!\n\nThe house is ours\nIt's time for big fun!\nBig fun!\nLet's use their showers\nThat sounds like\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nCrack open one more case!\nI think that\u2019s what they call \"third base.\"\n\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\n\nI'm actually having--!\n\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\n\nYo, rottweilers! What is Westerberg gonna do to the Razorbacks at Sunday's game?\n\nGonna make 'em go whee! Whee! Whee! Whee!\n\nAwwww!\nThe party's hot, hot, hot\nIt's time for big fun!\nBig fun!\n\nYou need a jello shot!\n\nWe're having big fun!\nBig fun!\n\nMartha Dumptruck, in the flesh\n\nHere comes the Cootie Squad\nWe should--\n\nShut up, Heather\n\nSorry, Heather\n\nLook who's with her -- Oh, my God!\n\nDang! Dang! Diggety-dang-a-dang!\nDang-dang! Diggety-dang-a-dang!\n\nI can't believe you actually came\n\nIt's exciting, right? Excuse me, I want to say hello to Ram. I brought sparkling cider!\n\nShowing up here took some guts\nTime to rip 'em out\n\nWell, who's this pig remind you of?\nEspecially the snout\n\nHah!\n\nDang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang!\nDang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang!\n\nHi, Ram! I wasn't gonna come, but since you took the trouble to write that sweet note\u2026\n\nWhat note? Why d'you gotta be so weird all the time? People wouldn't hate you so much if you acted normal... There's no alcohol in this. Are you trying to poison me?\n\nDang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang\nDang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang\nDang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang\nDiggety-dang-a-dang!\nThe folks are gone\nIt's time for big fun!\nBig fun!\nWe're up till dawn\nHaving some big fun! Big fun!\nSo let the speakers blow\nThey'll buy another stereo\nOur folks got no clue\n'Bout half the shit their children do\nWhy are they surprised?\nWhenever we're unsupervised\nIt's big fun!\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nBig fun!\nWhooo!1Embed"
