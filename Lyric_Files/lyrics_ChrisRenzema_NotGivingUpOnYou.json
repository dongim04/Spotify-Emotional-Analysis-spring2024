 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsNot Giving Up On You Lyrics\nI've heard faith's gone out of fashion\nLeast according to my old friends\nGuess I've never been one to\nKeep up with the modern trends\n'Cause maybe I'm out of style\nBut whether or not that's true\nWhen I look at the stars\nAll I see is You\n\nI've heard Christ is a crutch\nThat messed up people use\nTo make it through life\nWhen nothing else will do\nWell maybe I'm broken\nBut I'm not ashamed to say\nThat I need someone\nTo come save me\n\n'Caus\u0435 I'm not giving up on You\nOh, I'm not giving up on You\nNot giving up on You\n\nThis place feels like a ghost town\nWher\u0435 people used to live\nAll cleared out and broke down\nFrom the move back to Egypt\nAnd it feels lonely\nBut I know I'm not alone\nIt's just a pitstop\nOn my way back home\nSee Chris Renzema LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like\n'Cause I'm not giving up on You\nOh, I'm not giving up on You\nNot giving up on You\n\n'Cause I'm not giving up on You\nOh, I'm not giving up on You\nNot giving up on YouEmbed"
