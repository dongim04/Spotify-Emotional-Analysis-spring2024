 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsNot Good But Better Lyrics\nI ain't always good, but I'm feeling better though\nDrinking whiskey, hetero, calendar is lookin' like the\nSkillset, there ain't a lot of hoes in my schedule\nHomies on the same shit, I no longer meddle though\nI ain't tryna give the tea, but I got kettles though\nI want everyone to love me, but I'm a rebel though\nAnd my music take 'em places I don't get to go\nHaven't come to terms with that, I'll feel more than I'll ever know\n\nI hav\u0435 got to, I have got to\nI have got to get away 'for\u0435 I'm out of my mind\nI thought too hard, I lost you\nY'all try and stop, who really loves you? What you tryin' to find?\n\nTry and make space for my feelings, that shit make me humble\nSave grace for the meals, healin' is a stumble\nIf you gon' thank God for the blessings, thank Him for the troubles\nGet a couple chips, and then they fold, that's how the cookie crumbles\nI guess I let the fear project\nI say, I love, they hear, reject\nAnd here's the rub, I made a mess\nI cleaned it up by bleeding less\nCan't understand what we accept\nCan't understate how we neglect\nThey underrate 'til we give less\nI'm underpaid, I'm overstressed\nYou might also like\nI ain't always good, but I'm feeling better though\nDrinking whiskey, hetero, calendar is lookin' like the\nSkillset, there ain't a lot of hoes in my schedule\nHomies on the same shit, I no longer meddle though\nI ain't tryna give the tea, but I got kettles though\nI want everyone to love me, but I'm a rebel though\nAnd my music take 'em places I don't get to go\nHaven't come to terms with that, I'll feel more than I'll ever know\n\nI have got to, I have got to\nI have got to get away 'fore I'm out of my mind\nI thought too hard, I lost you\nY'all try and stop, who really loves you? What you tryin' to find?Embed"
