(My one and only baby)\nSay you'll be my darlin' (Be my, be my baby)\nBe my baby now (My one and only baby)\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\n\nI'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see\nFor every kiss you give me, I'll give you three\nOh, since the day I saw you\nI have been waiting for you\nYou know I will adore you 'til eternity\n\nSo won't you, please (Be my, be my baby)\nBe my little baby? (My one and only baby)\nSay you'll be my darlin' (Be my, be my baby)\nBe my baby now (My one and only baby)\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nYou might also like\n\nSo c'mon and be (Be my, be my baby)\nBe my little baby? (My one and only baby)\nSay you'll be my darlin' (Be my, be my baby)\nBe my baby now (My one and only baby)\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n\n\n(Be my, be my baby)\nBe my little baby? (My one and only baby)\nOh-oh-oh (Be my, be my baby)\nOh (My one and only baby)\nWoah-oh-oh-oh (Be my, be my baby)\nOh-oh-oh (My one and only baby)\nOh (Be my, be my baby)\nBe my baby now (My one and only baby)\nWoah-oh-oh-oh17Embed"
