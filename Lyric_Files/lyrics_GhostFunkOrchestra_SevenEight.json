 "lyrics": "1 ContributorSeven Eight LyricsSun moon, sky high\nWhy\u200a would I wanna be alone?\nTongue\u200a freeze, weak knees\nDon't be a tease on the telephone\nSomething calls my name but I don't answer\nWhy\u200a should I make myself known?\nI'm\u200a tired of trying\nTo act grown\nI\u200a fell in love\nLeast I believe\nThis is the way\nMy heart should feel\nStuck\u200a to my legs\nStiff as a tree\nRush to my head\nPassionate me\nWhen will you see?\nPalms sweat\nThey see me\nWe're a curiosity\nCrack in my walk\nSo now I fall faster\nHelpless as I can be\nYou might also likeI fell in love\nLeast I believe\nThis is the way\nMy heart should feel\nStuck to my legs\nStiff as a tree\nRush to my head\nPassionate me\nWhen will you see?Embed"
