Lyrics\nHey\n\nHaven't heard from you in a couple of months\nBut I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up\nAnd you're callin' my phone, you're all alone\nAnd I'm sensing some undertone\nAnd I'm right here with all my friends\nBut you're sending me your new address\nAnd I know we're done, I know we're through\nBut, God, when I look at you\n\nMy brain goes, \"Ah\"\nCan't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)\nLike blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)\nShould probably not\nI should probably, probably not\nI should probably, probably not\n\nSeeing you tonight\nIt's a bad idea, right?\nSeeing you tonight\nIt's a bad idea, right?\nSeeing you tonight\nIt's a bad idea, right?\nSeeing you tonight\nFuck it, it's fine\nSee Olivia Rodrigo LiveGet tickets as low as $67You might also like\nYes, I know that he's my ex\nBut can't two people reconnect?\nI only see him as a friend\nThe biggest lie I ever said\nOh, yes, I know that he's my ex\nBut can't two people reconnect?\nI only see him as a friend\nI just tripped and fell into his bed\n\nNow I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans\nI know I should stop, but I can't\nAnd I told my friends I was asleep\nBut I never said where or in whose sheets\nAnd I pull up to your place on the second floor\nAnd you're standing, smiling at the door\nAnd I'm sure I've seen much hotter men\nBut I really can't remember when\n\nMy brain goes, \"Ah\"\nCan't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)\nLike blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)\nShould probably not\nI should probably, probably not\nI should probably, probably not\nSeeing you tonight\nIt's a bad idea, right?\nSeeing you tonight\nIt's a bad idea, right?\nSeeing you tonight\nIt's a bad idea, right?\nSeeing you tonight\nFuck it, it's fine\n\nYes, I know that he's my ex\nBut can't two people reconnect?\nI only see him as a friend\nThe biggest lie I ever said\nOh, yes, I know that he's my ex\nBut can't two people reconnect?\nI only see him as a friend\nI just tripped and fell into his bed\n\nOh, yes, I know that he's my ex\nCan't two people reconnect?\nThe biggest lie I ever said\nI just tripped and fell into his bed\nMy brain goes, \"Ah\"\nCan't hear my thoughts\nThe biggest lie I ever said\nMy brain goes, \"Ah\"\nCan't hear my thoughts\nI just tripped and fell into his bed\nThoughts\nBlah\nThoughts\nBlah16Embed"
