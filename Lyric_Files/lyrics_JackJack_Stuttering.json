Or dance? Or something?\"\n\nCan't wrap my head around it\nCan't find the words to say\nDon't wanna live without it\nHow'd you make me feel this way?\nCan't wrap my head around it\nI can't find the words to say\nI don't wanna live without it\nHow'd you make me feel this way?\nYou got me s-s-s-s-stuttering\nI don't know what to say\nEvery time I get around you, baby\nI feel my s-s-stomach fluttering\nMy system getting overloaded\nEvery time you look me in my eyes\nWhen I'm alone, I'm a poet\nBut my words fall through in the moment\nYou got me s-s-s-s-stuttering\nI don't know what to say\nEvery time I get around you, baby, IEmbed"
