 "lyrics": "3 ContributorsWondering Why Lyrics\nShe comes from silver spoon, golden rule, private school, never miss Sunday Church\nAnd I come from blue-collar, low-dollar, out here where concrete meets old red dirt\nAnd I don't know what happened, but it sure don't add up on paper\nBut when I close my eyes late at night, you can bet I thank my maker\n\nShe keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am\nShe's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan\nLord, it's a little piece of Heav\u0435n when we lay down at night\nShe keeps on loving m\u0435 and I keep on wondering why\n\nShe's got a wicked smile, angel eyes, every guy wanting to hold her close\nShe's as pretty as sin like the sun sinking down on the California coast\n\nShe keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am\nShe's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan\nLord, it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night\nShe keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why\n\nI don't know what happened, but it sure don't add up on paper\nAnd as long as she lets me, I'll take her wherever she wants me to take her\nYou might also like\nShe keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am\nShe's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan\nAnd it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night\nBut she keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why\nShe keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why1Embed"
