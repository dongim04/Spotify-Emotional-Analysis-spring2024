Did I leave it in the cold?\nSo please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take\nIt must've fell when I lost my mind\nDeep in the cut, drowning it in pain\nSomebody help 'cause I can't find my way\nNobody move, nobody move\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nAhh-ahh\n\nSomebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel\nWhen I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)\nWhy in the world would I give my heart to you?\nJust to watch you throw it in the trash\nI've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on\nWhere were you when I needed you the most?\nNow I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest\nA heartless, broken mess\nSee Thundercat LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also like\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh\nLa-la-la, la-la\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh34Embed"
