 "lyrics": "67 ContributorsI Say No Lyrics\nYou are a drug, you are a poison pill\nI've got to kick this habit now or else I never will\nI loved the rush when you would hold me close\nBut you will not be satisfied until I overdose\nThis is it, hit the brake, I am finally awake\nLet me be, let me go\nYou need help I can't provide, I am not qualified\nThis troubled teen is getting clean\nI say no\n\nVeronica, who else is gonna\u2013\n\nNo, no, no, no!\n\nDon't say a word, you speak and I cave in\nYou'll twist the truth again and drill deep down beneath my skin\nYou said you'd change and I believed in you\nBut you're still using me to justify the harm you do\nThis is it, hit the brake, call it all my mistake\nLong as you let me go\nYou need help I can't provide, I'm not Bonnie, you're not Clyde\nIt's not too late, I'm getting straight\nI say no\nYou might also likeBlame your childhood, blame your dad\nBlame the life you never had\nBut hurting people? That's your choice, my friend\n'Cause I believe that love will win\nAnd hate will earn you nothing in the end\nThis is the end\n\nBut I love you!\n\nDude.\u00a0\n\nThis is it, I won't cry, starting now I will try\nTo pay back all the karma I owe\nStart again, somewhere new, far from cool guys like you\nSo goodbye, 'cause now I\nI say no\nJust in time I say no\nSomehow I'm saying no\nJust say no, I say no\nNo!5Embed"
