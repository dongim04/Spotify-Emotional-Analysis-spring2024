 "lyrics": "10 ContributorsGO TO HELL Lyrics\nWakin' up in the morning's hard\nI miss you even though it don't make sense\nIt's hurting in my chest to breathe\nWhen all I see are stories of our love\nSo hard, but it was not enough\nI'm goin' out to a party\nAnd the only thing they're asking's, \"How you are\"\nSayin' I'm okay, but really I'm cryin'\nAnd my head is so fucked from what you did\nI'm getting drunk\n\nTell me, tell me when\nDid you love somebody else?\nDid you care when you just\nTore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?\nWhy don't you take him and go to hell\n\nI'm tryin' hard to hate you\nBut I can't stop loving who I thought you were\nWas it ever real or were your lips just stained from him?\nDon't call me honey\nYou're the best and worst of all\nYou might also like\nSo tell me, tell me when\nDid you love somebody else?\nDid you care when you just\nTore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?\nWhy don't you take him and go to hell\n\nThis is my loving last farewell\nI hope you both go rot in hell\nThis is my loving last farewell\nI hope you both go rot in hell\n\nWhen did you love somebody else?\nDid you care when you just\nTore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?\nTell me, tell me when\nDid you love somebody else?\nDid you care when you just\nTore my heart to shreds in someone's bed?\nWhy don't you take him and go to hell1Embed"
