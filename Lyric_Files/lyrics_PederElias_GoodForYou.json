 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsGood For You Lyrics\nWearing plaid over denim like an anthem to the 90's\nHanging out on the corner by the place we used to chase our dreams\nNow it only reminds me of what you said to me\nAnd I'm picturing you laying next to him\n\nI don't wanna see you talk to someone new\nAnd I don't wanna hear you say the words I've said to you\nBut I understand someday that I will too\nSo if you really love him, love him\nBaby, good for you\n\nI could go to the clubs in the city where the wild things are\nAnd I could dance with the girls, drinking whiskey at the hotel bar\nWhen the place shuts down I could kiss her in the dark\nBut I know I'll be thinking about where you are\n\nI don't wanna see you talk to someone new\nAnd I don't wanna hear you say the words I've said to you\nBut I understand someday that I will too\nSo if you really love him, love him\nBaby, good for you\nYou might also like\nShe'll good and play my part\nWon't' come around and chase your heart\nGive you space if that's what you want\nI'll close my curtains and my eyes\nAnd let the TV drown my mind, oh no\nJust wanted you to know\nBaby, good for you\n\nI don't wanna see you talk to someone new\nAnd I don't wanna hear you say the words I've said to you\nBut I understand someday that I will too\nSo if you really love him, love him\nBaby, good for you\nSo if you really love him, love him\nBaby, good for youEmbed"
