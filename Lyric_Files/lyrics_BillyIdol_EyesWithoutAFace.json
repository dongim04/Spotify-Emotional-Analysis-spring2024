 "lyrics": "53 ContributorsEyes Without a Face Lyrics\nI'm all out of hope\nOne more bad break could bring a fall\nWhen I'm far from home\nDon't call me on the phone to tell me you're alone\nIt's easy to deceive\nIt's easy to tease, but hard to get release\n\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\nGot no human grace, your eyes without a face\n\nOoh, ch-ch\n\nI spent so much time\nBelieving all the lies to keep the dream alive\nNow it makes me sad\nIt makes me mad at truth for loving what was you\n\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\nGot no human grace, your eyes without a face\nSee Billy Idol LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like\nOoh, ha\n\n\nWhen you hear the music, you make a dip\nInto someone else's pocket, then make a slip\nSteal a car and go to Las Vegas\nOoh, the gigolo pool\nHanging out by the state line\nTurning holy water into wine\nDrinking it down\nOh-oh-oh\nI'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip\nReading murder books, trying to stay hip\nI'm thinking of you and you're out there, so\nSay your prayers\nSay your prayers\nSay your prayers\nOoh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh\n\nNow I close my eyes\nAnd I wonder why I don't despise\nNow all I can do\nIs love what was once so alive and new\nBut it's gone from your eyes\nI'd better realise\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\n(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face\nGot no human grace, your eyes without a face\n\nSuch a human waste, your eyes without a face\n\nAnd now it's getting worse10Embed"
