(After school)\nWe can hang around by the pool (Hang by the pool)\nDid your mom get back from her business trip? (Business trip)\nIs she there, or is she trying to give me the slip? (Give me the slip)\nYou know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be\nI'm all grown up now, baby, can't you see?\n\nStacy's mom has got it going on\nShe's all I want and I've waited for so long\nStacy, can't you see? You're just not the girl for me\nI know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom\n\nStacy's mom has got it goin' on\nStacy's mom has got it goin' on\n\nStacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (Mowed your lawn)\nYour mom came out with just a towel on (Towel on)\nI could tell she liked me from the way she stared (Way she stared)\nAnd the way she said, \"You missed a spot over there\" (Spot over there)\nAnd I know that you think it's just a fantasy\nBut since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me\nYou might also like\nStacy's mom has got it going on\nShe's all I want and I've waited for so long\nStacy, can't you see?
