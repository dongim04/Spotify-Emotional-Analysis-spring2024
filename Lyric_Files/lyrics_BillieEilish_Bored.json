(I need)\nForget about it\nWhen you walk out the door and leave me torn\nYou're teaching me to live without it\nBored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored\n\nI'm home alone, you're God-knows-where\nI hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah\nYou might also like\nGiving you all you want and more\nGiving you every piece of me\nI don't want love I can't afford\nI just want you to love for free\nCan't you see that I'm getting bored?\nGiving you every piece of me, piece of me\n\nI'm not afraid anymore\nWhat makes you sure you're all I need?\nForget about it\nWhen you walk out the door and leave me torn\nYou're teaching me to live without it\nBored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored\n\nGiving you what you're begging for\nGiving you what you say I need\nI don't want any settled scores\nI just want you to set me free\nGiving you what you're begging for\nGiving you what you say I need, say I need\n\nI'm not afraid anymore\nWhat makes you sure you're all I need?\nForget about it\nAnd when you walk out the door and leave me torn\nYou're teaching me to live without it103Embed"
