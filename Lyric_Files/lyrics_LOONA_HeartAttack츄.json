(Ah)\nYou attack my heart\nYou attack my heart\nYou attack my heart\nYou attack my heart (Damn!)\n\nThe day we first met\nInside my quiet heart\nAs if a new world has opened\nAccelerate particularly, move\nEven my hidden secrets that only I knew\nThat mood that i wanted to tell you all about\n\nThe fact that I took a step\nTowards you first\nIt lets me find myself that I didn\u2019t even know (Oh)\n\nPounding more and more\nI\u2019ll give it all, take my heart\nSurely you\u2019re my destiny\nIt shines fully in my heart\nThis must be what thrill feels like, darling\nEventually I fall into you\nYou attack my heart\nYou might also like\nYou attack my heart\nYou attack my heart (Ah-ah)\nYou attack my heart\nYou attack my heart (Damn!)\n\nThis is what \u201cfall in love\u201d is\nDipped you inside my white heart, and made it red\nCan\u2019t stop thinking about you\nI keep thinking about you more and more\nAll of my standards are set to you\nLike the moon spinning around the earth\nWe will, ooh-ooh, be seeing each other\nOn the ooh-ooh-ooh, on the love trail\n\nWhen I see you, spark\nIt\u2019s like there is a spark in my heart\nI find my hidden feelings (Oh)\n\nPounding more and more\nI\u2019ll give it all, take my heart\nSurely you\u2019re my destiny\nIt shines fully in my heart\nThis must be what thrill feels like, darling\nEventually I fall into you\nYou attack my heart\nI don\u2019t even realize how the time goes\nAnywhere anywhere, I think about you\nAnytime anyplace, it\u2019s full of you spreading out\nCome a little bit closer to me\nIf we face each other\nEven an imagination feels so sweet\n\nMy heart pounding towards you\nI\u2019ll give it all, take my heart\nSurely you\u2019re my destiny\nIt shines fully in my heart\n\nIt\u2019s getting clearer\nI\u2019ll give you all my heart, take my heart\nSurely we\u2019re destiny (Destiny)\nIt shines fully tonight\nThis must be what sweet addiction is, darling\nI fall deeper into you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)\nPounding more and more\nI\u2019ll give it all, take my heart\nSurely you\u2019re my destiny\nIt shines fully in my heart (Take my, take my heart)\nThis must be what thrill feels like, darling\nEventually I fall into you\nYou attack my heart4Embed"
