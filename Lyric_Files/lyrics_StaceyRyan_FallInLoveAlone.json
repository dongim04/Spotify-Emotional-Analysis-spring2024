 "lyrics": "12 ContributorsFall In Love Alone Lyrics\nI'm familiar with unrequited\nI know you got a heart that's undecided just like mine\nIt takes its sweet time\nI been shy to dive into the deep end\n'Cause I don't really wanna lose a good friend, but I might\nFind something divine\n\nIt's electric every time we touch\nI've been living for this head rush\nBut sometimes it's too much\n\nIf we never try\nHow will we know\nBaby, how far this thing could go\nGive me a sign\nIf I'm on your mind\nI don't want to fall in love alone\n\nI wish that I could tell what you were thinking\nI hate that I slip up when I've been drinking, but oh w\u0435ll\nI can't help myself\nI'm getting r\u0435ally tired of this back and forth\nWhy don't we just give in to this driving force? I mean\nThere's something between us\nYou might also like\nIt's electric every time we touch\nI've been living for this head rush\nBut sometimes it's too much\n\nIf we never try\nHow will we know\nBaby, how far this thing could go\nGive me a sign\nIf I'm on your mind (You know that you're on my mind)\nI don't want to fall in love alone\n(I don't want to fall in love alone)\nIf we never try (I don't want to fall in love alone)\nHow will we know\nBaby, how far this thing could go (Just how far this thing will go)\nGive me a sign (Give me a sign, give me a sign)\nIf I'm on your mind\nI don't want to fall in love alone (Alone)\n(Ooh)\n\nFall, I don't wanna fall\nI don't wanna fall in love alone (You just need to be right here next to me)\nFall, I don't wanna fall (Next to me, next to me)\nI don't wanna fall in love alone (I don't wanna be without you, baby)\nFall, I don't wanna fall (I don't want)\nI don't wanna fall in love alone (I, I, I)\nFall, I don't wanna fall (I can't be alone)\nI don't wanna fall in love alone (Alone)4Embed"
