You should check your light bulbs\nI\u2019ma be on board till you rappers get your flights up\nI\u2019m in the class you was never in\nI\u2019m in the class\u2014where the hell you been?\nI watch them watch me settle in\nI never pretended to be better than\nA lotta y\u2019all provide the same shit\nAnd then they fuckin\u2019 with mine\nYou don\u2019t know nobody?\nYou stuck in the line\nYou flat out broke\nSo you be pressed for time\nAnd I ain\u2019t broke\nAnd I be pressed for mine\nSome niggas couldn\u2019t take the career change\nSo they pressed decline\nShit, that ain\u2019t gonn\u2019 stop my shine\nExcept that, that man upstairs decided to close the blinds\nIf not the money, the cars and clothes is mine\u2019s\nAnd them hoes is mine\u2019s\nIf any of those don\u2019t exist might as well\nClose the line\nIf you see, she\u2019s on her way\nNow who am I to judge?\nThe case is closed\nAnd the fakes exposed\nThen they turn back around like the place is closed\nThen they keep goin\u2019 like the brakes is old\nMy life is like a confession\nIt\u2019s probably a lesson\nAfter I tell y\u2019all I be hearin\u2019 suggestions\nSome might think it\u2019s good or a bad impression\nEff them, I R-Les them\nNext selection\nI be on my shit, ha\nFuck those who ain\u2019t up on theirs\nI know it\u2019s all unfair\nThey get mad when I take them back to the crib\nShow them how I live\nIt wasn\u2019t a problem before, now it\u2019s just that serious\nIt\u2019s just that big\nPause. I don\u2019t feel the need to brag though\nSubtract it fast, but I add slow\nYour best friends will take your career and throw it in the bag\nAnd walk around let the mutha fuckin\u2019 tag show\nIf you see, she\u2019s on her way\nGood morning to the ordinaries\nGood night to the unliked in the night clubs\nAin\u2019t got an idea? You should check your light bulbs\nI\u2019ma be on top\u2014 the hottest position ever\nBut a position that doesn\u2019t last forever\nCan I get some credit, but instead I\u2019m getting debit love\nMan, I wish you could edit love\nI\u2019ll settle where I want it\nSo everything: I run it\nSo I could say I done it\nAnd still keep it a hundred\nI\u2019m good; I\u2019m where that ass is supposed to be\nNow the haters getting close to me\nFemales push-up with their push-up\nHaters tryin\u2019a punk me\u2014Ashton Kutcher\nTryin\u2019a get their name up, with a little spot in this rap game\nTryin\u2019a keep their kush up, for realYou might also likeEmbed"
