Don't you care, Sera?\nThat just because someone is dead, it doesn't\nMean they can't resolve to change their ways\nTurn the page, escape infernal blaze\n\nI'm sure you wish it could be so\nBut there's a lot that you don't know\nYou might also like\nWhat are we even talkin' about?\nSome crack-whore who fucked up already?\nHe blew his shot, like the cocks in his mouth\nThis discussion is senseless and petty\n\nThere's no question to be posed\nHe's unholy, case closed\nDid you forget that Hell is forever?\n\nA man only lives once, we'll see you in one month\nGotta say, I can't wait to\n\nAdam\n\nCome down and exterminate you\n\nWait!\n\nShit\nWhat are you saying? Let me get this straight\nYou go down there and kill those poor souls?\n\nYou didn't know?\n\nWhoops\n\nGuess the cat's out of the bag\n\nWh-what's the big deal?\n\nSera, tell me that you didn't know\n\nI thought, since I'm older\nIt's my load to shoulder\n\nNo!\nYou have to listen, it was such a hard decision\nI wanted to save you, the anguish it takes to\nDo what was required\n\nTo think that I admired you, well\nI don't need your condescension\nI'm not a child to protect\nWas talk of virtue just pretension?\nWas I too na\u00efve to expect you\nTo heed the morals you're purveying?\n\nThat's what the fuck I've been saying!\n\nIf Hell is forever, then Heaven must be a lie (Emily!)\nIf angels can do whatever, and remain in the sky\nThe rules are shades of gray when you don't do as you say\nWhen you make the wretched suffer just to kill them again\n\nI was told not to trust in angels\n\nBy her?\n\nHa! She should know\n\nWe should go\n\nNo! Don't you see? We've come so close\nLook at them fighting, they're at each other's throats\n\nDon't you act all high and mighty\nDid you ever think your little girlfriend might be a liar?\n\nDon't, Adam please!\n\nWhat's the fuss?\nWhy hide the fact that you're an angel just like us?3Embed"
