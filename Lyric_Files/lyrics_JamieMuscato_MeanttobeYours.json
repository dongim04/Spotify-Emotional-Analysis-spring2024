 "lyrics": "9 ContributorsMeant to be Yours Lyrics\nAll is forgiven baby!\nCome on out and get dressed\nYou're my date to the pep rally tonight!\n\nWhat!\nWhy?\n\nOur classmates thought they were signing a petition\nYou gotta come out here and see what they really signed!\n\nYou chucked me out like I was trash\nFor that you should be dead\nBut! But! But!\nThen it hit me like a flash\nWhat if high school went away instead?\nThose assholes are the key\nThey're keeping you away from me\nThey made you blind, messed up your mind\nBut I can s\u0435t you free!\nYou left me and I fell apart\nI punch\u0435d the wall and cried\nBam! Bam! Bam!\nThen I found you changed my heart\nAnd set loose all this truthful shit inside\nAnd so I built a bomb\nTonight our school is Vietnam\nLet's guarantee they'll never see their senior prom!\nYou might also likeI was meant to be yours\nWe were meant to be one\nDon't give up on me now\nFinish what we've begun\nI was meant to be yours\nSo when the high school gym goes, boom!\nWith everyone inside\nPkhw! Pkhw! Pkhw!\nIn the rubble of their tomb\nWe'll plant this note explaining why they died!\n\nWe, the students of Westerberg High\nWill die\nOur burnt bodies may finally get through\nTo you\nYour society churns out slaves and blanks\nNo thanks\nSigned, the students of Westerburg High\nGoodbye\n\nWe'll watch the smoke pour out the doors\nBring marshmallows\nWe'll make s'mores\nWe can smile and cuddle while the fire roars!\nI was meant to be yours\nWe were meant to be one\nI can't make it alone\nFinish what we've begun!\nYou were meant to be mine\nI am all that you need\nYou carved open my heart\nCan't just leave me to bleed!\nVeronica!\nOpen the\u2014open the door, please\nVeronica, open the door\nVeronica, can we not fight anymore, please?\nCan we not fight anymore?\nVeronica, sure, you're scared\nI've been there, I can set you free!\nVeronica, don't make me come in there\nI'm gonna count to three!\nOne!\nTwo! Fuck it!\n\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah\n\nNo! God, no! Veronica!\nPlease, don't leave me alone\nYou were all I could trust\nI can't do this alone\nStill I will if I must!\nVeronica?\nI made you a snack\nVeronica?\nAagh!2Embed"
