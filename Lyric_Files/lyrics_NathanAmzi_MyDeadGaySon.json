It is ignorant, hateful talk like yours that makes this world a place our boys could not live in!\nThey were not dirty!\nThey were not wrong!\n(sung)\nThey were two lonely verses\nIn the Lord's great song!\n\nOur boys were pansies, Bill!\n\nYes!\nMy boy's a homosexual\nAnd that don't scare me none\u2014\nI want the world to know...\nI love my dead gay son!\n(spoken)\nI've been thinking. Praying. Reading some magazines. And it's time we opened our eyes!\n(sung)\nWell, the good Lord made gay penguins\nAnd gay bonobo chimpanzees\nI\u2019ve seen gay lions show their pride in documentaries\nIf nature gets her orders\nHanded down from god above\nThen animal or human\nYou can\u2019t help the one you love\nThey were not dirty\u2014\nThey were not fruits!\nThey were just two strong laces in the Lord's big boots\nWell, I never cared for homos much until I reared me one\nYou might also like\nBut now I've learned to love\u2026\n\nI love my dead gay son!\n\nHe loves his son\nHe loves his son\nHis dead gay son!\n\nNow, I say my boy's in heaven!\nAnd he's tanning by the pool\nThe cherubim walk him and him, and Jesus says it's cool!\nThey don't have crime or hatred, there's no bigotry or cursin' -\nJust friendly fellows dressed up like their fav'rite Village Person!\nThey were not dirty\u2014\n\nWhoa!\n\nThey just had flair!\n\nWhoa!\nThey were two bright red ribbons in the Lord's long hair\nWell, I used to see a homo and go reachin' for my gun\n\nBut now I've learned to love\u2026\n\nAnd furthermore!\nThese boys walked hand in hand!\nThese boys, they took a stand!\nThey could not wait\nOne second longer to be free!\nThey cast off their disguise\nNo shame, no compromise!\nPaul, I can't believe that you\nStill refuse to get a clue\nAfter all that we been through\u2014\n(spoken)\nI'm talkin\u2019 you and me!\n(CONGREGATION gasp)\nIn the summer of '83!\n(CONGREGATION gasp again)\n\nThat was one hell of a fishing trip\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa!\nThey were not dirty\u2014\nWhoa!\nAnd not perverse\u2014\nNo, no!\nThey were just two shiny rhinestones\nOn the Lord's big purse!\n\nOur job is now continuing the work that they begun!\n\n'Cause now we love, love, love!\nWe love your dead\u2014\n\nThey're up there disco dancing to the thump of angel wings!\nThey grab a mate\nAnd roller skate\nWhile Judy Garland sings!\nThey live a joyful afterlife that's fancy-free and reckless!\nThey swing upon the pearly gates\u2014\nAnd wear a pearly necklace!\n\nWhoo!\n\nThey were not dirty!\n\nNo!\n\nThey were good men! (Whoa!)\nAnd now they're happy bear cubs in the Lord's big den!\n\nGo forth and love each other now\nLike our boys would have done\n\nWe'll teach the world to love...\n\nI love my dead gay son!\nMy son! My son!\n\nNot half bad, your dead gay son!\nWish I had your dead gay son!\nThank you, dad, for your...\n\nDead! Gay! Son!Embed"
