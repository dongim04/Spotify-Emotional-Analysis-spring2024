I'm baffled\nAn epic battle where evil and the will to evolve is what I'm involved in\nHey God, is Earth gon' keep revolvin'?\nCan't you see I'm lost here? Can't you see we lost here?\nTried to get to Heaven but we see that Heaven cost here, huh?\nPestilence, famine and death, what I'm forgettin'?\nWho's that sittin' straight to the left? War\nThey say the Horsemen comin'\nThis couldn't be what you summoned\nThe children hide and they runnin', my prayers are at your door\n\n'Cause they smacked us in the face with that bullshit\nNow I gotta focus on makin' my soul lit\nWorst come to worst then I'm hopin' my soul live\nWorst come to worst then I'm clutchin' the full clip\n'Cause they smacked us in the face with that bullshit\nNow I gotta focus on makin' my soul lit\nWorst come to worst then I'm hopin' my soul live\nWorst come to worst then I'm clutchin' the full clip\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, da-da)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, la-la)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, da-da)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, la-la)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, da-da)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, la-la)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, da-da)\nIf worst come to\u2014 (Da, da-da-da, la-la)\nIf worst come to\u20146Embed"
