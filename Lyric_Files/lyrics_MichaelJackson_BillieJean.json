Her schemes and plans\n'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)\nSo take my strong advice\nJust remember to always think twice\n(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)\nShe told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me\nThen showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)\n'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)\nYou might also like\nPeople always told me, \"Be careful of what you do\nAnd don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts\" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)\nBut she came and stood right by me\nJust the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)\nThis happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)\nShe called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey\n\nBillie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one\nBut the kid is not my son\nNo-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)\nBillie Jean is not my lover, uh\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)\nBut the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)\nShe says I am the one (Oh, baby)\nBut the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee, ah, hee-hee-hee)\n\nHee, hoo\n\nShe says I am the one, uh\nBut the kid is not my son (No-no-no, hoo, ohh)\nBillie Jean is not my lover, uh\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)\nBut the kid is not my son\nNo-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)\nShe says I am the one (No)\nBut the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)\nShe says I am the one (You know what you did)\nShe says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)\nShe says I am the one\nYeah, yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh\nYeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh\nYeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)\nYeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)\nBillie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; she's not at the scene)\nBillie Jean is not (Hee), aaow, ooh\nYeah, Billie Jean is142Embed"
