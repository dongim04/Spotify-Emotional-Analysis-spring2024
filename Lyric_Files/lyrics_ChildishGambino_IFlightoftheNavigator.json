I talked to some birds. I fell in love again. And none of this ever ended. Everything just kept going, and going, and going. And even when you laughed, you cried. And even when you were sad, you were really happy. 'Cause you were here, and I got to meet every star. Every planet, everything that made me. And we all kissed, and became the same. We became the same, we became the same.\"\n\nWho would have thought this? We almost lost it\nWhen you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see\nAnd we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance\nTo tell you that I haven't been\n\nWe are all cold water\nWhy try at all? Why bother?\n\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\n\nWho would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this\nIt would be some type of meanness to where you are\n'Cause I don't know where to go\nAnd no one else seems to know\n\nWe are all knight's fallen\nWhy try at all? Dark calling\nSo we're left alone, no one left to call upon\nBe still my broken bones, as I travel on\nYou might also like\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nHold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nSo we're left alone, no one left to call upon\nBe still my broken bones, as I travel on\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\n\nCold wa\u2013\nCold wa\u2013\n140Embed"
