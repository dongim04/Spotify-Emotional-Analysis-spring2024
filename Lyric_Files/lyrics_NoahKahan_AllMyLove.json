Well, love, now that you mention it\nMy folks still talk, but they speak in these two-word sentences\nI'm sayin' too much, but you know how it gets out here\nNo winter coat could keep out all the cold of your atmosphere\n\nWe once sang\n\"Retrograde\", we'd shake the frame of your car\nNow I know your name, but not who you are\nIt's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood\nIt's all my love, you got all my love\nI'm still out here with the pills and the dogs\nIf you need me, dear, I'm the same as I was\nIt's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood\nIt's all my lov\u0435, you got all my love\nYou got all my love\n\nWrite m\u0435 a list of how it is, of how it was, of how it has to be\nYou burrowed in under my skin, what I'd give to have you out from me\nBut I still recall how the leather in your car feels\nAnd at the end of it all, I just hope that your scars heal\nSee Noah Kahan LiveGet tickets as low as $110You might also like\nWe once sang\n\"Retrograde,\" we'd shake the frame of your car\nNow I know your name, but not who you are\nIt's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood\nIt's all my love, you got all my love\nI'm still out here with the pills and the dogs\nIf you need me, dear, I'm the same as I was\nIt's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood\nIt's all my love, you got all my love\nYou got all my love\n\nWell, I leaned in for a kiss thirty feet from where your parents slept\nAnd I looked so confident, babe, I swear I was scared to death\nMy hands gripped the wheel, I smiled stupid the whole way home\nWell, those five words in my head, you said, \"I'll never let you go\"\n\nOh, I sang\n\"Retrograde,\" we'd shake the frame of your car\nNow I know your name, but not who you are\nIt's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood\nIt's all my love, you got all my love\nAnd it's still out here with the pills and the dogs\nWind chill this year stole the words from my tongue\nIt's all okay, there ain't a drop of bad blood\nIt's all my love, you got all my love\nYou got all my love\nYou got all my love\nYou got all my love\nYou got all my love1Embed"
