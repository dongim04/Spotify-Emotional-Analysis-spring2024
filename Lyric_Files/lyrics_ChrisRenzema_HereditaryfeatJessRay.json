 "lyrics": "4 ContributorsHereditary Lyrics\nOne, two, three\n\nI've seen a saint fall from grace\nBut I\u2019m not sure that I'd use that phrase\nSo, if grace is something you can misplace\nThen what's the point of it anyway?\n\u2019Cause I said it would never be me\nTo waver in this faith, I decree\nThe apple don't fall far from the tree\nThe human condition's hereditary\nOh, the human condition's hereditary\n\n'Cause it's in the blood coursing through my veins\nSame old story, same family name\nProne to wonder, this heart in me\n'Cause the human condition's hereditary\nSo would you come take an axe to my family tree?\nOh, heavenly father, would you adopt me?\n\nWell I\u2019ve stood by in disbelief\nWatching the pastor pull up in a sports car to preach\nAbout how blessed are the poor and blessed are the meek\nAnd I can\u2019t help but see the irony\n'Cause that same impulse lives in me too\nPut me in the garden, I\u2019ve taken the fruit\nThe human condition's not just for the few\nOh, it's here in me just like it's here in you\nSee Chris Renzema LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like\nIt\u2019s in the blood coursing through my veins\nSame old story, same family name\nProne to wonder, this heart in me\n'Cause the human condition's hereditary\nSo would you come take an axe to my family tree?\nOh, heavenly father, would you adopt me?\n\n'Cause it's in the blood coursing through my veins\nSame old story, same family name\nProne to wonder, this heart in me\n'Cause the human condition's hereditary\nSo would you come take an axe to my family tree?\nWould you pull up the roots of my family tree?\nOh, heavenly father, would you adopt me?Embed"
