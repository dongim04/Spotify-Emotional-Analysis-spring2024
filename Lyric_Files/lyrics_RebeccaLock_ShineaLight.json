 "lyrics": "6 ContributorsShine a Light Lyrics\nDeep inside of everyone\nThere's a hot ball of shame\nGuilt, regrets, anxiety\nFears we dare not name\nBut, if we show the ugly parts\nThat we hide away\nThey turn out to be beautiful\nBy the light of day!\nWhy not-\n\nShine, shine, shine a light!\n\nOn your deepest fears!\n\nLet in sunlight now\n\nAnd your pain will disappear!\n\nShine, shine, shine\nYou might also like\nAnd your scars and your flaws\n\nWill look lovely because you shine!\n\nYou shine a light\n\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine, shine, shine a light\n\nEveryday's a battlefield\nWhen pride's on the line\n\nI attack your weaknesses\n\nAnd pray you don't see mine\n\nBut if I share my ugly parts\nAnd you show me yours\n\nOur love can knock our walls down\n\nAnd unlock all our-\n\nDoors!\n\nShine, shine, shine a light\n\nOn your deepest fears!\n\nLet in sunlight now\n\nAnd your pain will-\n\nDisappear!\nWho wants to share what's in their heart?\nNo volunteers? Fine, I'll start\nMy name's Pauline\nI live alone\nMy husband left\nMy kids are grown\nIn the 60s love was free\nThat did not work out well for me\nThe revolution came and went\nTried to change the world\nBarely made a dent\nI have struggled with despair\nI've joined a cult\nChopped off my hair\nI chant, I pray, but god's not there\nSo Steve! I'm ending our affair!\nAnd I faked it, every single time\nWoo, now that felt fan-fricking-tastic\n1, 2, take me home kids!\n\nShine, shine, shine a light\n\nOn your deepest fears!\n\nLet in sunlight now\n\nAnd your pain will disappear!\n\nShine, shine, shine\n\nAnd your scars and your flaws\n\nWill look lovely because you shine!\n\nYou shine, you shine a liiiiiiiiiiiight\n\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine, shine, shine a light\n\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine, shine, shine a light\nShine a light! YEAH!Embed"
