Yeah\n\n(Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)\n(Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, yeah-yeah)\n\nOh, we'll dance until we say goodbye (Hey)\nA thousand miles between, th\u0435re are only blue, blu\u0435 skies\nTell me where we are in a fallen star\nAnd as your eyes light up, catch me in a fairytale\nYou might also like\nYou're violet crazy (Hey)\nIt's what I'm meant to be\nThere was no silence, baby\nBetween you and me, oh\nAnd it drives me crazy (Hey)\nIs this meant to be?\nI've been so tired lately\nBetween you and me (You and me, yeah)\n\n(Oh-whoa-oh-oh) Yeah\n(Oh-whoa-oh-oh) Ah-ooh-ooh-oohEmbed"
