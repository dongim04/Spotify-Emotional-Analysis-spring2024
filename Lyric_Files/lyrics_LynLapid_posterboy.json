(All along)\nOr am I just wishful thinking\nAnd I don't know you at all?\nYou could be a killer who's on the loos\u0435\nThe next day I'll end up on the news\nOh, I don't care, you can call me a fool\n'Cause I got a good feeling about\nYou might also like\nYou and I\nIt's you and I\nI see my life\nIn your eyes\n\nKnow we just met\nI gotta confess\nWith you, I don't see an end, 'cause\nYou'll be the death of me\nMy greatest enemy\nBut for now\n\nIt's you and I\nIt's you and I\nI see my life\nIn your eyes4Embed"
