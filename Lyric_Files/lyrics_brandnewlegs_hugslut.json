Imma slut for a hug\nI just wanna feel like somebody that's loved\nSomebody who cares and somebody who eats\nAnd somebody who bothers putting socks on their feet\nBut you don't feel that too\nYou\nI hope I haunt you in your dreams\nSending whispers to your door\nIntrospection isn't always bad\nWhen I'm feeling sad\nWhen I'm feeling sad\nSad\nSadEmbed"
