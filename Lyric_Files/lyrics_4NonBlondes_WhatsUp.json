Lyrics\n25 years and my life is still\nTryin' to get up that great big hill of hope\nFor a destination\nI realized quickly when I knew I should\nThat the world was made up of this brotherhood of man\nFor whatever that means\n\nAnd so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed\nJust to get it all out what's in my head\nAnd I, I am feeling a little peculiar\nAnd so I wake in the morning and I step outside\nAnd I take a deep breath and I get real high\nAnd I scream from the top of my lungs\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nAnd I say, hey-ey-ey\nHey-ey-ey\nI said \"Hey, a-what's going on?\"\nAnd I say, hey-ey-ey\nHey-ey-ey\nI said \"Hey, a-what's going on?\"\n\nOoh, ooh\nOoh\nOoh, uh huh\nOoh, ooh\nOoh\nOoh, uh huh\nYou might also like\nAnd I try\nOh my God, do I try\nI try all the time\nIn this institution\nAnd I pray\nOh my God, do I pray\nI pray every single day\nFor revolution\n\nAnd so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed\nJust to get it all out, what's in my head\nAnd I, I am feeling a little peculiar\nAnd so I wake in the morning and I step outside\nAnd I take a deep breath and I get real high\nAnd I scream from the top of my lungs\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nAnd I say, hey-ey-ey\nHey-ey-ey\nI said \"Hey, what's going on?\"\nAnd I say, hey-ey-ey\nHey-ey-ey\nI said \"Hey, a-what's going on?\"\nAnd I say, hey-ey-ey\n(Wake in the morning and step outside)\nHey-ey-ey\n(Take a deep breath and I get real high)\n(And I scream)\nI said \"Hey, a-what's going on?\"\nAnd I say, hey-ey-ey\n(Wake in the morning and step outside)\nHey-ey, yeah yeah yeah\n(Take a deep breath and I get real high)\n(And I scream)\nI said \"Hey, a-what's going on?\"\nOoh, ooh\nOoh\nOoh, uh huh\n\n25 years and my life is still\nTryin' to get up that great big hill of hope\nFor a destination, mmm56Embed"
