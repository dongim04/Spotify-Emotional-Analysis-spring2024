 "lyrics": "15 ContributorsYo Girl Lyrics\nI hear last night, Martha Dumptruck did a cannonball off the Mill Creek Bridge holding a suicide note\n\nOh my God. Is she alive?\n\nJust some broken bones. Yet another geek trying to imitate the popular people and failing, big time\n\nYo -\nGirl -\nKeep it together\nI -\nKnew -\nYou would go far\nNow -\nYou\u2019re -\nTruly a Heather\nSmell -\nHow -\nGangsta you are\n\nMartha, I\u2019m so sorry!\nYou might also like\nYo -\nGirl -\nFeel a bit punchy?\nWhat\u2019s -\nThat -\nBrimstoney smell?\nNow -\nYou\u2019ve -\nEarned that red scrunchie\nCome-\nJoin -\nHeather in hell!\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nWe\u2019ve been worried sick! Your friend J.D. stopped by. He told us everything?\n\n...\u2018Everything\u2019?\n\nYour depression? Your thoughts of suicide?\nHe even showed us your copy of Moby Dick!\n\nThis is not my handwriting!\n\nI\u2019ve been on the phone all morning. There\u2019s a doctor in Cleveland, we\u2019d like you to talk with him\n\nWhat kind of doctor?\n\nPsychiatric\n\nLeonard!\n\nWhat?\n\nGuess who\u2019s right down the block\n\nYou\u2019re sending me to a shrink?!\nGuess who\u2019s climbing the stairs\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in getting some help\n\nGuess who\u2019s picking your lock\n\nI am not the problem!\n\nTime\u2019s up! Go say your prayers!\n\nShe took that well\n\nVeronica\u2019s running on, running on fumes now\nVeronica\u2019s totally fried\nVeronica\u2019s gotta be tripping on \u2018shrooms now\nThinking that she can hide\nVeronica\u2019s done for, there\u2019s no doubt now\nNotify next of kin!\nVeronica\u2019s trying to keep him out now\nTOO LATE!\nHe got in!\n\nKnock! Knock! Sorry to come in through the window\nDreadful etiquette, I know!\n\nGet out of my house!Embed"
