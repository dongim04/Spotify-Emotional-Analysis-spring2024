('Round)\nI still won't ever seek out\nAnything you've given me now\nSo what now baby?\n\nBeen lying through the phone\nThat I'll still be coming home\nBut I'll never kiss and tell\nSo superstitious that\nYou can't swallow up the fact\nThat I'll still see you in hell (hell)\nYou might also like\nHow (How)\nAre you still running around? ('Round)\nI still won't ever seek out\nAnything you've given me now\nSo what now baby?\nStop (Stop)\nI never opened up shop\nEverything I've heard from you sucks\nAnd I still don't know if you really love\nMaking me crazy (Hell)\nHow (How)\nAre you still running around? ('Round)\nI still won't ever seek out\nAnything you've given me now\nSo what now baby?\nStop (Stop)\nI never opened up shop\nEverything I've heard from you sucks\nAnd I still don't know if you really love\nMaking me crazy (Hell)Embed"
