She been gettin' it on her own, nigga\nSelf made, ain't nobody doin' gold digger\nNow, Miss India always speaks with her chest\nGot respect from her people 'cause she leads them the best\nHm, real life queen in the flesh\nKnow the crown get heavy, still it be's on your head\nBrooklyn ladies, know you hustle on the daily\nInnovative just like Donna Summer in the eighties\nYour time, they seein' you glow now\nIntelligence and elegance, show 'em how\nMiss Jamaica understand food for the soul\nShe get up in the kitchen know she throw down\n\nAin't nothin' without a woman, no\nWoman to woman, I just wanna see you glow\nTell 'em what's up\n\nI love how you go from zero to one hundred\nAnd leave the dust behind, you've got this\nAll action, no talk\nI see you glow, you're the finest gold\nWhen you walk in the room, they feel your soul\nOur style, it shines, so ahead of time\nAnd you know that you're fire, you're so damn fine, girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\n\nShe a Ghana girl\nCalm with it, never let the marijuana fail\nThough a sucker for the romance, take you to the homeland\nOne way, she ain't comin' back, nah\nAll I see is Black stars and I friggin' love it, yeah, yeah\nTime's up, tell the people that we comin', yeah, yeah\nDone bein' in the shadow, goin' public, yeah, yeah\nDon't know how to bear it, how to stomach, yeah, yeah\nHand over the shit and let us run it, yeah, yeah\nAll we know is lookin' flawless, all they know is stare, stare\n\nAin't nothin' without a woman, though\nWoman to woman, I just wanna see you glow (Glow, glow)\n\nI love how you go from zero to one hundred\nAnd leave the dust behind, you've got this\nAnd lead them with your light\nYou've got this (Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow)\nAll action, no talk (Tell 'em what's up)\nYou know, Simbi\nSometimes, you know, I just look around\nAnd I just think of all the things we've gone through\nAll the great things in life and all the horrible things that are just the other half of the great things in life\nAnd how you don't really get greatness without sacrifice\nAnd you don't get good things without a little bit of pain\nAnd how happiness is the substitute for the emptiness that you can sometimes feel on the other side\nI dunno, it just reminds me to call you\nBut then you never pick up the phone!10Embed"
