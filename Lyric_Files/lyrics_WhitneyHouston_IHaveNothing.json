One I can hold on to\nYou might also like\nI don't really need to look very much further\nI don't wanna have to go where you don't follow\nI won't hold it back again, this passion inside\nI can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide\nYour love, I'll remember forever\n\nBut don't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nDon't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me, no\nDon't walk away from me\nDon't you dare walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nIf I don't have you\n\nYou\nIf I don't have you\nOh, you65Embed"
