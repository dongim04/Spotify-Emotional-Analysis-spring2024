Yeah\n\nSteadily\nBecoming my enemy\nThis energy\nI swear there's no remedy\nTired of the bullshit\nYou already know this\nProlly happy that I wrote this\n'Cause you the center of the focus, yeah\nAnd once again\nI don't really ever wanna be your friend\nI'm not gonna give you all my time to mend\nThe breaks, th\u0435 bends\nYou're faker than a happy \u0435nd, mm\n\nYou know I'm not the one to start a war\nAt any time you can just run for the door\nYou say I'm not your responsibility\nSo why you callin' every time you drink too fucking heavily? Yeah\nYou might also like\nI am always your go to\nBut I can never go to you\n'Cause you just quit (tired of the bullshit)\nAnd you dismiss (you already know this)\nAll my shit (prolly happy that I wrote this)\nI'm just, I'm tryna tell you that\nOnce again\nI don't really ever wanna be your friend\nI'm not gonna give you all my time to mend\nThe breaks, the bends\nYou're faker than a happy end, mm\n\nYou know I'm not the one to start a war\nAt any time you can just run for the door\nYou say I'm not your responsibility\nSo why you callin' every time you drink too fucking heavily? Yeah\n\nIt's the nail in the coffin\nNot water under bridges that I'm burning\nBridges that I'm burnin', yeah\nIt's the nail in the coffin\nNot water under bridges that I'm burning\nBridges that I'm burnin', yeah1Embed"
