 "lyrics": "5 ContributorsManiac Lyrics\nJust a steel town girl on a Saturday night\nLookin' for the fight of her life\nIn\u2005the\u2005real-time world no\u2005one sees her at all\nThey all\u2005say she's crazy\nLocking rhythms to the beat of her heart\nChanging woman into life\nShe has danced into the danger zone\nWhen a dancer becomes a dance\n\nIt can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire\nOn a wire between will and what will be\n\nShe's a maniac, maniac on the floor\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\nShe's a maniac, maniac on the floor\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\n\nOn the ice-thin little line of insanity\nIs a place most never see\nIt's a hard-won place of mystery\nTouch it, but can't hold it\nYou work all your life for that moment in time\nIt could come or pass you by\nIt's a push of the world, but there's always a chance\nIf the hunger stays the night\nThere's a cold kinetic heat\nStruggling, stretching for defeat\nNever stopping with her head against the wind\nYou might also like\nShe's a maniac, maniac, I sure know\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\nShe's a maniac, maniac, I sure know\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\n\n\nIt can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire\nOn a wire between will and what will be\n\nShe's a maniac, maniac, I sure know\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\nShe's a maniac, maniac, I sure know\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\n\nManiac, maniac, I sure know\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before\nShe's a maniac, maniac, I sure know\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before1Embed"
