 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsDark Holes Lyrics\nFeeling this blackened sun\nPlunging into darkness where my torment has begun\nSearing this very soul\nThere's nothing there beneath me, there's been nothing left to hold\n\nAs my conscience fades away\nDrawing closer to the grave\nThere is nothing left to say so release me\n\nHow can I love you if all you ever do is call on me?\nHow can I show you if all you ever seek ain't what you need?\nHow can I know you? Reaching further only brings me grief\nBut how can I leave you now? Dark holes are deepening\n\n'Round and around we go\nPreparing your excuses, all these tears are just for show\nWrapping around my brain\nProtecting your own ego, I'm about to go insane\n\nAs my conscience fades away\nDrawing closer to the grave\nThere is nothing left to say\nThe time has come to lead the way\nLet your wicked ways decay\nI won't let you slip away and away again\nYou might also like\nBlack holes run deeper\nBlack mountains steeper\nAnd now you're stepping in shit\n\n\nHow can I love you if all you ever do is call on me?\nHow can I show you if all you ever seek ain't what you need?\nHow can I know you? Reaching further only brings me grief\nBut how can I leave you now? Dark holes are deepening\nEmbed"
