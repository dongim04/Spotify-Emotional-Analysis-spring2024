 "lyrics": "21 ContributorsBeautiful Lyrics\nSeptember 1st, 1989\nDear diary:\nI think I'm a good person. I believe there's good in everyone\nBut here we are, first day of senior year\nI see these kids I've known all my life and wonder:\nWhat happened?\n\nFreak! Slut!\nBurnout! Bug-eyes!\nPoser! Lard-ass!\n\nWe were so tiny\nHappy and shiny\nPlaying tag and getting chased\n\nFreak! Slut!\nLoser! Short bus!\n\nSinging and clapping\nLaughing and napping\nBaking cookies, eating paste\nYou might also like\nBull-dyke! Stuck-up!\nHunchback!\n\nThen we got bigger\nThat was the trigger\nLike the Huns invading Rome\n\nMove!\n\nSorry!\n\nWelcome to my school, this ain't no high school;\nThis is the Thunderdome\nHold your breath and count the days-\nWe're graduating soon\n\nWhite trash!\n\nCollege will be paradise\nIf I'm not dead by June!\nBut I know, I know\nLife can be beautiful\nI pray, I pray\nFor a better way\nIf we changed back then\nWe could change again\nWe can be beautiful...\n\nOw!\n\nJust not today\n\nHey, are you okay?\n\nGet away, nerd!\n\nFreak! Slut! Cripple!\nHomo! Homo! Homo!\n\nThings will get better\nSoon as my letter\nComes from Harvard, Duke, or Brown\nWake from this coma\nTake my diploma\nThen I can blow this town\nDream of ivy-covered walls\nAnd smoky French caf\u00e9s\nWatch this!\n\nFight the urge to strike a match and set this dump ablaze!\n\nOops!\n\nRam Sweeney. Third year as linebacker, and eighth year of smacking lunch trays and being a huge dick\n\nWhat did you say to me, skank?\n\n...Nothing!\nBut I know, I know...\nLife can be beautiful\nI pray, I pray...\nFor a better way\nWe were kind before\nWe can be kind once more;\nWe can be beautiful... (Beautiful...)\n\nAaaagh!\n...Hey, Martha\n\nHey!\n\nMartha Dunnstock. My best friend since diapers\nShe's got a huge heart. 'Round here, that's not enough\nThanks\n\nWe on for movie night?\n\nYou're on Jiffy Pop detail\n\nI rented The Princess Bride.\n\n...Again? Don't you have it memorized by now?\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a sucker for a happy ending\n\nMartha Dumptruck! Hahahaha!\nIf you wanna lose a few pounds, you need more protein in your diet\n\nKurt Kelly. Quarterback. He is the smartest guy on the football team. Which is kind of like being the tallest dwarf\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nI'm sorry, are you actually talking to me?\n\nMy buddy Kurt asked you a question\n\nWhat gives you the right to pick on my friend? Look at you, you're a high school has-been waiting to happen. A future gas station attendant\n\nYou got a zit right there\n\nDear diary...\nWhy....\n\nWhy do they hate me?\n\nWhy don't I fight back?\n\nWhy do I act like such a creep?\n\nWhy\u2026\n\nWhy won't he date me?\n\nWhy did I wear this?\n\nWhy do I cry myself to sleep?\n\nWhy\u2026\n\nSomebody hug me!\nSomebody fix me!\nSomebody save me!\n\nSend me a sign, God!\nGive me some hope, here!\nSomething to live for!\n\nAh... Heather, Heather, and Heather!\n\nThen there's the Heathers. They float above it all\n\nI love Heather, Heather, and Heather\n\n(I hate Heather, Heather, and Heather)\nHeather McNamara, head cheerleader. Her dad is loaded\u2014he sells engagement rings\n(I want Heather, Heather, and Heather)\nHeather Duke, runs the yearbook. No discernible personality, but her mom did pay for implants\n(I need Heather, Heather\u2014)\nAnd Heather Chandler, the Almighty\nShe is a mythic bitch\n\nThe Heathers are solid Teflon\u2014never bothered, never harassed\nI would give anything to be like that\n\nMmmm...\n\nI'd like to be their boyfriend\n\nThat would be beautiful...\nMmmm...\n\nIf I sat at their table, guys would notice me\n\nSo beautiful...\nOoooh...\n\nI'd like them to be nicer\n\nThat would be beautiful...\nOoooh...\n\nI'd like to kidnap a Heather and photograph her naked in an abandoned warehouse and leave her tied up for the rats\n\nGrow up, Heather. Bulimia is so '87\n\nHeather, I need a mint\n\nWhat you need, Heather, is to see a doctor\n\nAh, Heather and Heather--\nAnd Heather. Perhaps you didn't hear the bell over all the vomiting. You're late for class\n\nHeather wasn't feeling well. We're helping her\n\nNot without a hall pass you're not. A week's detention\n\nWhat? No way, that's not fair!\nBut I've got cheerleader practice!\nMy parents pay your salary!\n\nActually, Ms. Fleming, all four of us are out on a hall pass. Yearbook committee\n\nI see you're all listed. Hurry up and get where you're going\n\nThis is an excellent forgery. Who are you?\n\nVeronica... Sawyer. I crave a boon\n\nWhat boon?\n\nLet me sit at your table, at lunch. Just once. No talking necessary. If people think you guys tolerate me, they'll leave me alone\nBefore you answer, I also do report cards, permission slips, and absence notes\n\nHow about prescriptions?\n\nShut up, Heather\n\nSorry, Heather\n\nFor a greasy little nobody, you do have good bone structure\n\nAnd a symmetrical face. If I took a meat cleaver down the center of your skull, I'd have matching halves. That's very important\n\nOf course, you could stand to lose a few pounds\n\nAnd you know, you know, you know?\nThis could be beautiful\nMascara, maybe some lip gloss\nAnd we're on our way\nGet this girl some blush\nAnd Heather, I need your brush\nLet's make her beautiful...\n\nLet's make her beautiful...\n\nLet's make her beautiful...\n\nMake her beautiful...\nOkay?\n\nOkay!\n\nOut of my way, geek!\n\nI don't want trouble\u2014\n\nYou're gonna die at 3pm!\n\nDon't you dare touch me! Get away, pervert!\n\nWhat did I ever do to them?\n\nWho could survive this?\nI can't escape this!\nI think I'm dying!\n\nWho's that with Heather?\n\nWhoa!\nHeather, Heather, Heather...\n\nAnd someone!\n\nHeather, Heather, Heather...\n\nAnd a babe!\n\nHeather, Heather, Heather...\n\nVeronica?\n\nVeronica? Veronica? Veronica!!\n\nAnd you know, you know, you know... (Ooohhhh!)\nLife can be beautiful (Aaahhh! Beautiful!)\nYou hope, you dream, you pray (Ooohhhh!)\nAnd you get your way! (Aaahhh!)\nAsk me how it feels (Beautiful!)\nLookin' like hell on wheels... (Ooohhhh!)\nMy God, it's beautiful! (Beautiful!)\nI might be beautiful... (Beautiful!)\nAnd when you're beautiful... (Aaahhh!)\nIt's a beautiful frickin' day! (Heather! Heather! Heather! Veronica!)\nYeah-eah-eah! (Heather! Heather! Heather! Veronica!)\n\nVeronica! Veronica! Veronica!\nVeronicaaaaa!Embed"
