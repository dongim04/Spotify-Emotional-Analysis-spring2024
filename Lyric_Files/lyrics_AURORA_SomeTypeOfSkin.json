It's a lot\n(I build some type of skin\nI've got to build some type of skin)\nMy God! It's a lot\n(I build some type of skin)\n(I've got to build some type of skin)\n\nI guess I should build some type of skin\nAnd let breath b\u0435 air\nAnd love the things I know might disappear\nAnd th\u0435 last light of the sun (Sun)\nI let it slow me down\nI'll crawl where everybody runs\nSee AURORA LiveGet tickets as low as $160You might also like\nWe're good people\nAnd we deserve peace\nIt's difficult, it seems\n\nMy God! It's a lot\n(I build some type of skin)\n(I've got to build some type of skin)\nMy God! It's a lot\n(I build some type of skin)\nMy God!\n(I've got to build some type of skin)\nMy God! It's a lot\n(I build some type of skin)\n(I've got to build some type of skin)\nMy God! It's a lot\n(I build some type of skin)\nMy God! My God!\n(I've got to build some type of skin)\n\nIt's a lot\nIt's a lot\nMy God! It's a lot\nIt's a lot, a lot to me\nTo me2Embed"
