 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsJelly Surfing Lyrics\nI feel like Peter Pan looking in through your window\nI'm jealous of your plans while I stand here in limbo\nAnd all of my friends started families of their own\nI'm happy for them but damn I'm in Neverland\nWhere nothing ever seems to happen\nI'm jelly surfing\n(Ok, stop)\n\nA month in Japan, Huntington, then to Rio\nI'm watching 'em win while I'm spinning my wheels\nI shy from the world as I'm shifting my gears\nMy snippets on the Gram left intentionally unclear\nSo people have nothing to jeer\n\"What are you doing?\"\nBroke, I pretend that I meant to be here\nWhen my flop \u0435ra ends, will I grin\nThinking of these past y\u0435ars?\nI should've never had no need for jelly surfing\"\n\nBut now I look, to everyone, like the unsavory son\nWithout an ounce of aplomb\nAnd with a useless diploma\nAnd I am battling the voices in the back of my dome\nTell me I'm living it wrong\nI should be further along\nDon't want my life plans fueled by a fear\nThat I will look foolish to the tune of my peers\nBut I can't help comparing to conventional ideals\nAnd I could make an end of my torture-like pastime\nYet I'm jelly surfing\nI'm jelly surfing\nYou might also like\nI'm happy for them but damn I'm in Neverland\nWhere nothing ever seems to happen\nShould I not go and find out?\nNow I know that there ain't no doubt\nI'm jelly surfing\n(I feel like Peter Pan looking in through your window)Embed"
