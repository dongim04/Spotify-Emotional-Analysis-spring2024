And, um... I'm sorry that I'm crying right now, but I'm drunk, and um...\nI miss you, so much. And I know that this is bullshit, because you found a new perfect girl for you...\"\n\nI'll slaughter them all (But you)\nA portrait of a lady on fire in my head\nI'll surrender and crawl\nEven if it breaks me\nJust say that you will never leave\nCause you're heavenly, uhEmbed"
