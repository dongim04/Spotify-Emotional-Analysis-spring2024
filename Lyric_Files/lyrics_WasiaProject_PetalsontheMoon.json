 "lyrics": "7 ContributorsPetals on the Moon Lyrics\nFeeling down\nOrange juice\nCigarette\nTo get me through\nAs it rains\nI conclude\nI need help\nFrom someone new\n\nSo take me in your spaceship\nThrow me up into new places\nBlast me into silence\nLet your guidance get me through this\nGravity is pulling me\nAlong and I can't find a way\nTo understand\nWhy I'm here again and again, oh\n\nI feel like everybody's singing out of tune\nI feel like I can't help but always be so blue\nBut in the end I know I must keep pulling through\nAnd brace myself for all the hell-lik\u0435 petals on the moon\nYou might also like\nFeeling cold\nTrain delay\u0435d\nYou've gone home\nAnd I'm afraid\nHelios\nSun divine\nHold me up\nInto the sky\n\nYou take me in your spaceship\nThrow me up to constellations\nBlast me into silence\nLet your guidance get me through this\nGravity is pulling me\nAlong and I can't find a way\nTo understand\nWhy I'm here again and again, oh\n\nI feel like everybody's singing out of tune (I feel so blue)\nI feel like I can't help but always be so blue (Keep pulling through)\nBut in the end I know I must keep pulling through\nAnd brace myself for all the hell-like petals on the moon\nBorn again, alone again, again\nHome again, you're gone again, again, again\nWill somebody be there for me when all my friends have left?\nEven if I'm undone in the end, ooh\n\nI feel like everybody's singing out of tune (I feel so blue)\nI feel like I can't help but always be so blue (Keep pulling through)\nBut in the end I know I must keep pulling through\nAnd brace myself for all the hell-like petals on the moon\nEmbed"
