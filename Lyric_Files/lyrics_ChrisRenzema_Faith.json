Lyrics\nI, I've been working on the ways\nThat I lose my head some days\nI just can't keep it together\nI, I keep trying to soldier on\nTrying to put it in a song\nBut I just start to unravel\n\nFaith feels like a free fall sometimes\nI guess I still freak out sometimes\nFaith feels like a free fall sometimes\nI guess I still get scared sometimes\n\nI, I'm just trying to understand\nIs there some master plan?\n'Cause I've got so many questions\nAm I, am I the only one?\nFeels like this ladder's missing rungs\n'Cause I can't find a way to climb it\n\nStepping out onto the water\nNot sure if you'll sink or stand\nI think fear's pretty normal\nWhen you've only ever walked on land\n'Cause to leap into the unknown\nIs to walk by faith not sight\nWe all get scared of what we don't know\nAnd maybe that's alright\nSee Chris Renzema LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like\nFaith feels like a free fall sometimes\nI guess I still freak out sometimes\nYeah, faith feels like a free fall sometimes\nI guess I still get scared sometimes\nAnd maybe that's alright\nMaybe that's alright\nMaybe that's alright\n\nFaith feels like a free fall sometimes\nI guess I still freak out sometimes\nYeah, faith feels like a free fall sometimes\nI guess I still get scared sometimes\nAnd maybe that's alright\nMmm-mmm, mmm\nMmm-mmm\nMmm-mmm, mmmEmbed"
