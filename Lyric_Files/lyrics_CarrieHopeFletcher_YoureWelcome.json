 "lyrics": "66 ContributorsYou\u2019re Welcome Lyrics\nAw, you can't just leave...\n\nNot when you're dressed like that...\n\nDressed like what? This is what I always wear\n\nYeah and it's torture!\n\nHow can you expect us to control ourselves when you look like that?\n\nDear Diary\nHere we are in the dark fifty yards from my car\nI could climb that tree, I'd never get that far...\nThey're a hundred pounds heavier, they have my keys\nI'm a rat in a trap, correction:\nI'm the cheese\n\nHey there girl, ignore this fool\nHe tries to play cool while he\u2019s dribbling drool\nYou might also like\nJust trying to say in our friendly way\nThat you\u2019ve gotten hotter like every day\n\nOW!!\n\nHey there girl, avoid this punk\nHe\u2019s hungry for a hunk of the junk in your trunk\n\nThere is no lie, that dog won\u2019t try\nWhen a tasty treat like you walks by, cause\n\nOnce, you were geeky and nerdy\nNow you\u2019re flirty, freaky, and dirty\n\nYou were nothing and nobody..\n\n...but now you\u2019re good enough to\n\nGet with me! HUH!\nYou\u2019re welcome, look where you are\nYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019ve won a football star!\nYou\u2019re welcome\n\nBaby, what's that smell?\n\nThat's the smell of me lovin' you well\n\nYou're welcome!\n\n\nThis is not a drill\nThis is not a bad dream\nIn a cow pasture, no one can hear you scream\nNever break their stare, stay awake, stay aware\nYou're not in real danger 'til they grab your hair\n\nCome back girl, now don\u2019t play hurt\nIf you don\u2019t want me starin\u2019, why you wearin\u2019 that skirt?\nWe can\u2019t be tamed and we can\u2019t be blamed\nIt\u2019s all your fault that we\u2019re inflamed!\n\nCause once, you were grody and grotty\n\nNow you\u2019ve got a body like a Maserati!\n\nStroke my fur, make me purr-\nHey! You wanted to be\n\nPopular!\n\nHit me!\n\nHUH!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome, look where you are\nYou\u2019re welcome, come get your football star\nYou\u2019re welcome\n\nYou've joined the pros!\n\nOnce we squeeze you\nYou'll stay \"squoze\"\n\nYou\u2019re welcome in my lap, welcome on my knee\n\nWell, come on and get grabby in the grass with me!\n\nI got one last chance to save my ass\nWhat was that move from my self-defence class?\n\nI\u2019ll steal your heart like a thief\nBring you sweet relief\n\nCall me Wendy cause you never wonder\n\n\u2018Where\u2019s the beef?\u2019\n\nThey're a powder keg\nSo don't yell or beg\nStay friendly\nThen gently, accidentally sweep the leg\n\nAh! This mud stinks!\n\nUgh, gross!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome...\n\nBack up fool, you reek!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome...\n\nWell, you smell like a sewage leak\n\nYou\u2019re welcome...\n\nWait, dude\nI'm pretty sure\nThis ain't mud- it's\n\nCOW MANURE!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nAh, it's everywhere!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome\n\nHold on, it's in my hair!\n\nYou\u2019re well-\n\nHey, girl\nNow let's not dwell\nI'mma smell\nYou can tell\nI can still be lovin' you well!\n\nSwell!\n\nNo, I'll be lovin' her well!\n\nSee you in Hell!\n\nNo, I'll be lovin' her well!\nNo, I'll be-\nI'll be-\nI'll be-\nI'll be-\nLovin' lovin' lovin' lovin' lovin' her well!\nYou're welcome!\nYou're welcome!\n\nYou're welcome!Embed"
