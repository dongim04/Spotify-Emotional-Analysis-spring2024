 "lyrics": "20 ContributorsOur Love Is God Lyrics\nThey made you cry\nBut that will end tonight\nYou are the only thing that's right\nAbout this broken world\nGo on and cry\nBut when the morning comes\nWe\u2019ll burn it down and then\nWe'll build the world again...\nOur love is God\n\nAre you okay?\n\nI was alone\nI was a frozen lake\nBut then you melted me awake\nSee, now I'm crying too\nYou\u2019re not alone\n\nYou're not alone\n\nAnd when the morning comes\nYou might also like\nWhen the morning comes\n\nWe'll burn away that tear, and raise our city here...\n\nRaise our city here...\n\nOur love is God\n\n\nYeah-lo?\n\nKurt?\n\nHey, Veronica?!\n\nSorry about the other night, I just couldn't decide which of you two \"hot gentlemen\" I wanted to be with. And then I realised: Why decide at all?\nWait, what?\n\nMeet me at the cemetery, at dawn\n\nWho?! Me or Ram?\n\nYes\n(VERONICA hangs up)\n\nWhat did she want?\n\nUs!\n\nNo way!\n\nPunch it in!\nWe can start and finish wars\n\nWe're what killed the dinosaurs\nWe're the asteroid that's overdue\nThe dinosaurs choked on the dust\nThey died because God said they must\nThe new world needed room\nFor me and you\n\nI worship you\nI'd trade my life for yours\nThey all will disappear\nWe\u2019ll plant our garden here\n\nPlant our garden here\n\nOur love is God\n\nOur love is God\n\nOur love is God\n\nOur love is God\n\nWhoa. Are those guns real?\n\nYeah, but we\u2019re filling them with \"Ich Luge\" bullets\n\nIch Luge?\n\nUgh, my grandad scored them in World War II. They contain a powerful tranquilizer. The Nazis used them to fake their own suicides when the Russians invaded Berlin. We'll use them to knock out Ram and Kurt long enough to make it look like a suicide pact. Complete with a forged suicide note:\n\n\"Ram and I died because we had to hide our gay forbidden love from a misapproving world.\"\n\nAnd when the morning comes\nThey\u2019ll both be laughing stocks\n\nSo let's go hunt some jocks!\n\nHi... Veronica\n\nSo, uh, do we just, uhhm, w-whip it out or what?\n\nTake it slow, Ram. Strip for me\n\nWhat about you?\n\nI was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport\n\nWe can do that\n\nCount of three\n\nOne... two\u2026\n\nThree\n\n\nAh! Holy crap!\n\nStay there! I'll get him back\n\nRam?\n\nWhy are you chasing me?!\n\nYou\u2019re just unconscious, right? Ram? Ram!\n\nI was just kidding about your girlfriend being a whore!\n\nGet off the fence! Get off the damn fence!\n\nI don't understand!\n\nWe can start and finish wars\nWe're what killed the dinosaurs\nWe're the asteroid that's overdue\n\nStop being a dick!\n\nThe dinosaurs will turn to dust\n\nWhat does that mean?!\n\nThey'll die because we say they must\n\n\nWhat the fuck have you done?!\n\n...I worship you\nI'd trade my life for yours\nWe'll make them disappear\nWe'll plant our garden here\nOur love is God\nOur love is God\nOur love is God\nOur love is God\nOur love is God\n\nOur love is God...\n\nOur love is God\u2026\n\nOur love is God...\n\nOur love is God\u2026!Embed"
