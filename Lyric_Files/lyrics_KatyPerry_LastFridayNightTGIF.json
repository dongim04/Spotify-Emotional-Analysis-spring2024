Lyrics\nThere's a stranger in my bed\nThere's a pounding in my head\nGlitter all over the room\nPink flamingos in the pool\nI smell like a minibar\nDJ's passed out in the yard\nBarbies on the barbecue\nThis a hickey or a bruise?\n\nPictures of last night ended up online\nI'm screwed, oh well\nIt's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled\nDamn\n\nLast Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops\nAnd we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot\nLast Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards\nAnd got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard\nLast Friday night, we went streaking in the park\nSkinny dipping in the dark then had a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\nLast Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law\nAlways say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah\nYou might also like\nBut this Friday night\nDo it all again\nBut this Friday night\nDo it all again\n\nTrying to connect the dots\nDon't know what to tell my boss\nThink the city towed my car\nChandelier is on the floor\nRipped my favorite party dress\nWarrant's out for my arrest\nThink I need a ginger ale\nThat was such an epic fail\n\nPictures of last night ended up online\nI'm screwed, oh well\nIt's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled\nDamn\n\nLast Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops\nAnd we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot\nLast Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards\nAnd got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard\nLast Friday night, we went streaking in the park\nSkinny dipping in the dark then had a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\nLast Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law\nAlways say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah\nBut this Friday night\nDo it all again (Do it all again)\nThis Friday night\nDo it all again (Do it all again)\nThis Friday night\n\nT.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F\nT.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F\n\n\nLast Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops\nAnd we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot\nLast Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards\nAnd got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard\nLast Friday night, we went streaking in the park\nSkinny dipping in the dark then had a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\nLast Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law\nAlways say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah\n\nBut this Friday night\nDo it all again\n32Embed"
