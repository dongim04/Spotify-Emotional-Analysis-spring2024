 "lyrics": "2 ContributorsA Four Chord Protest Lyrics\nWell Jesus, you always took the time to\nBe with all the lowest and the last in the line\nNo matter what they were like or on which side\nIn the middle of the night\nJesus, you always took the time\n\nThis is a four chord protest\nTo the idea this world doesn't break your heart\nMhm, mm-mhm\n\nSo why do I find it so hard each time to\nStop and ask if I'm your hands and feet, why don't I\nDo the things that you do? I lay down my pride\nFor those the Father calls His child\nWhy do I find it so hard each time?\n\nThis is a four chord protest\nTo the idea this world doesn't break your heart\nMhm, mm-mhm\n\n'Cause I believe\nYou'd be what I am scared to be\nOh and I believe\nYou'd be with the prostitute, the houseless\nThe destitute, the hopeless\nThe places that I'd get so uncomfortable to be\nYou always seem\nSee Chris Renzema LiveGet tickets as low as $30You might also like\nTo take the time\nYou always took the timeEmbed"
